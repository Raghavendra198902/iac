### Architecture Methodologies

#### Architecture Development Lifecycle
1. **Current State Assessment** - Understand as-is architecture
2. **Future State Vision** - Define target architecture
3. **Gap Analysis** - Identify gaps and opportunities
4. **Roadmap Planning** - Plan transition architecture
5. **Implementation** - Execute architecture initiatives
6. **Governance** - Monitor compliance and value realization
7. **Continuous Improvement** - Iterate and optimize

#### Architecture Maturity Models
**Levels** (0-5 scale):
- **Level 0**: No architecture practice
- **Level 1**: Initial/Ad-hoc - Informal architecture efforts
- **Level 2**: Defined - Basic processes and standards
- **Level 3**: Managed - Formal governance and metrics
- **Level 4**: Optimized - Continuous improvement
- **Level 5**: Innovative - Industry-leading practices

**Assessment Areas**:
- Governance and organization
- Architecture process and methodology
- Architecture content and artifacts
- Architecture tools and repository
- Architecture skills and competencies
- Stakeholder engagement
- Value realization
